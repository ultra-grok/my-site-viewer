It was a horrible time in my life due to living with my mother and finally having the chance to cut her out of my life. I can admit because of it was an emotional wreck and this guy was stable and didn't know how to deal with me. We ended by him avoiding for a month or so after going to a festival with my friends. When I think back I wish he just ended. So after he ended it added my depression I suffered but my friends helped me through it and I got rid of everything from him along with cutting contact. \n\nNow: Its been almost 3 years now and I've gotten better after counselling and mild anti depressants. My mother has been out of my life since then so there's been alot of progress. Being stronger after learning some lessons there been more insight about that time of my life but when I see him or a picture everything comes back. The emotions and memories bring me back down. \n\nHis friends (both girls) are on my facebook because we get along well which is hard to find and I know they'll always have his back. But seeing him in a picture or talking to him at a convention having a conversation is tough. Crying confront of my current boyfriend is something I want to avoid. \n\nSo I've been thinking that I have to cut contact with these girls because it's time to move on because it's healthier. It's best to avoid him as well. But will they be insulted? Will they accept it? Is there going to be awkwardness? I'm not sure if it's the right to do and could use some outside opinions.\n\nTL;DR:",

Frankly, the only reason I'm not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I'm confident in the rest of my body, I've had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It's a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it's not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.\n\nWould I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual?

He scheduled the hysteroscopy and the aspiration of the mass for the next day. I was horrified and scared shitless. My boyfriend was very supportive, stayed up late rubbing my neck the night before the procedure, came with me to the doctor, took me out for more meals than I can count so that I didn't have to cook, etc.\n\nIt's been a week since the procedures and, frankly, I don't really feel any less scared, anxious, or paranoid.

She wants to pay me about 10$/hour which is a ridiculous amount of money for this small favor. \n\nHer perspective:\nIn my opinion he will put more effort in to it when knowing that he get's something from it. I would like to keep it in a professional way so it's effective at the end. I feel like it's a win-win situation for both of us since I would pay way more for a stranger giving me tutoring lessons and he can use the money to have fun.

And it got MUCH better since I started going onto meds.\n\nPlus, after being unemployed (GFC) for awhile, and then being scammed by a \"social marketing expert\" friend, I finally got a job at a decent place, although it had completely nothing to do my degree.\n\nBut I still have much fallout in that a person who was a massive part of my life and whom I grew up with is no longer any part of my life, and I can't forgive friends who still stay in contact with her despite what I felt she did to me. \n\nPlus, I still end up chucking sickies at work to this day to deal with days when my moods just seem to go out the window, and my black dogs still haunt me from time to time.\n\nI've scheduled time to finally see a shrink to hopefully work out my issues once and for all. \n\nMy question to the rest of Reddit is - have you ever been in the same situation, and most importantly, how did you rebuild your life?

I felt like I was completely alone and had to fake any happiness that I presented to my friends. I made a lengthy post on FB basically ranting about this and she messaged me a short time later.

She said he was a bit of a dick. My friend (also her best friend), being a boss of a wingwoman, told her \"don't go for dicks, because you'll just end up getting hurt\". So the girl I like asked \"But who isn't a dick?\" and my friend pointed at me and said \"He's not a dick, he's my best friend\". \n\nNext day I decided to talk to her over facebook and ask if she wanted to see a film which she said she really wanted to see. (I've already seen it but it's so good I want to go twice). She said it's be \"really nice\" and we organised a day. I asked her about getting something to eat before and she said we could just \"go and have a coffee\". \n\nThe thing is, I don't fully know whether it's an actual date, or just as friends. We both really love the film, so it could just be that, but we don't really know each other well enough for it to be something friends would do.

I have rinsed and repeated up until my final class which is next semester and I have become known as the local expert on that band by both faculty and students alike. They also believe me to be completely obsessed with that band. I beg to differ as I mainly did it for the grades (even though I did find a good chunk of the research very interesting).

You all gave me the courage I needed to message her.\n\nAfter I made the original post I gave him one more opportunity to come clean to his fiancée. I confronted him and told him that the games had to stop. Either he told her or I did. He responded that I was bluffing, a bitch, and she wouldn't believe me.\n\nSo I sent her the screenshots of our conversations, and my phone number. I told her to call me if she had any questions regarding what I sent her.\n\nThe evidence was on my side, 90% of our recent conversation were filled with \"Are you sure you don't have a fiancée?\" and him denying it and calling her *crazy*, *obsessed*, and that she needed to *let go*. \n\nI took a huge risk giving her my number. But the news I gave her needed to be discussed over the phone or in person. She called me an hour later. I expected her to be angry with me, possibly cuss me out. Call me a whore perhaps but she didn't. She cried for a long time and when she was able to speak she thanked me.\n\nWe talked for awhile about their relationship and about how she caught him talking to another girl in the past but let that one slide for the sake of her childern. This apparently was the icing on the cake. She added me on Facebook and when she broke up with him she went on Facebook and wrote about how she almost made the biggest mistake of her life. She personally tagged me and thanked me again that status. Felt a little weird about that but I rolled with it.\n\nIt wasn't two hours after that status was posted his messaged me and called me a stupid cunt. I was delusional and he never liked me. I ruined his relationship.. A load of bullshit. I sent her those messages and we laughed about it.\n\nWe may have met through weird circumstances but I may have made a new friend.\n\nI don't regret telling her one bit, she seems like a wonderful person and she didn't deserve what he was doing to her.\n\nTL;DR:",

Just the DAY before, she was telling me how she loved me and what not.\n\nI can only assume she either cheated or is suddenly caught up in the fervor of partying abroad and wants to sleep around.

I was trying to block his punches cos he was drunk and was punching pretty hard. After he stopped, I was complaining about the punches and shit then I went back to raving and grinding with the girl I was hooking up with. The thing is that I forgot to put my donger back in my shorts so he was raving with me. All my mates were laughing, the girl I was with turned around and laughed too but I was too drunk to care and continued for a while until 10-15 minutes later this stranger came up with me and pointed at my donger. I shoved it back in whilst everyone was still laughing. Again I was too drunk to give a fuck so I just raved on. The girl was cool with it and stayed with me still.

What can we do to help him?\n\nPOST: Here's how it happened: \n\nMy mother was scolding him for his mess and told him to do fold some towels. Before there are any suspicions, my mom wasn't scolding him in a demeaning or abusing way; she is just tired of telling him over and over again to pick up after himself. Next thing I hear, he is calling for me from our family room and tells me our sun conure is \"sick\". When I get to the birdcage I see that our bird is lying on the top of the cage, bleeding from his nose, and clearly struggling to breathe. I ask my brother what happened and he tells me the bird \"fell from his cage\". I call desperately for my mom and she tells me he is dying. The next two minutes are complete agony as I watch my bird, *who has been one of my best friends for the last 11 years*, die by suffocating on his blood. At this point I'm in tears, and I ask my brother exactly what happened since there is no way falling from his cage would have caused such severe injuries. He finally confesses that he smacked the bird with a towel. There was no point in asking 'why' since he does this kind of stuff all the time.\n\nOur dilemma:\n\nMy family and I don't know what to do with our brother anymore. He is an angry middle schooler and has a history of being somewhat violent (i.e., throwing books at his classmates for making fun of him), but this is an entirely new low for him. He has talked to the school counselor and has had regular sessions with a therapist, but I feel they are useless. His counselors have always given him the benefit of the doubt and held us responsible for his behavior. This troubles me as it removes any responsibility or sense of remorse for his actions. Case in point, when my mom talked to him about what he did he said that \"it wasn't his fault he inherited his dad's temper\". My bird did not deserve to die this way, and I fear that his anger problem could get worse. I will continue to follow his counselors advice and try to understand him, but it's difficult when he rejects advice and gets visibly frustrated when my mom or dad talk to him.\n\nTL;DR:",

Problem is, houses in that area go for anywhere between 350 - 750k (right up to a million). I don't really want to get into managing a restaurant because I don't like the work load/salary trade off. I'm willing to work my butt off, but I don't know if the service industry fits my 5-10 year goals. \n\nWhat's more so, I am completely debt free and hesitant to go back to school unless it's for something considered a pretty safe bet. I don't have a lot of people in my life who are older and wiser than me, and so I'm not sure how to plan out my next career move. I was thinking about saving money and heading back to community college, but I have no idea what for. \n\nI guess I'm posting this because I'm hoping to find someone who has been in a similar situation and come out the other side. I want to start looking for professionals to network with in my community to get input and contacts, but again, I don't really know how. Has anyone here done something similar to what I'm trying to do? Again, I'm willing to work hard for a few years to achieve my goals, I just don't want to compound my issues with student debt if I don't have to.\n\nI should mention I also have retail management experience and I am planning on being functionally fluent in Spanish by December. \n\nAny advice is truly appreciated.

Ideally I will get into a fully funded phd program and get a 25k/year or so stipend, but there is a chance I will do an in-state not-funded masters first. I still have enough in my college fund to cover the pretty inexpensive in-state tuition for 4 semesters, but I would either have to have enough savings to live on for 2 years, or take out loans. \n\nSo now the question is how much I should contribute to the 403(b). On one hand, I could max it out ($16,500) and not feel a thing even though I only make 30k pretax at that job, because I could just start supplementing my significantly reduced paycheck with savings. Or I could throw in like 5-7k just to get retirement savings started, but still keep more liquid. When I go to grad school, I can either keep it in the 403(b) or roll it over to an IRA.\n\nI know having 30k in savings is not the best use of that money, but will the compound interest on putting a big chunk of it in the 403(b) outweigh potentially having to take out loans for grad school?\n\nTL;DR:",

In the end it broke down to communication issues, nothing particularly harmful that was done to one another. She said it's not longer worth the fight and wanted to break up.

I live with my mom, who has been my primary source of financial support since my parents separated. She makes less than half of what my father makes.\n\nWhen filling out my fafsa, I was unsure how to handle this situation, but after researching online, it seemed that every source I could find (except for official government sites, which were silent on the issue) said the same thing: I should just report one parents income, unless I live in a community property state (which I do, Texas), in which case I should report half of the joint income. This was exactly what I did. In hindsight, I realize I should have checked with a counselor or something before submitting.\n\nToday, I was contacted by my school's automated system, and they want me to submit verification of the information I entered. I'm realizing now that if I was mistaken about how to fill out the FAFSA in my situation, halving all the information from my parents tax returns might look like fraud, particularly given that I won't have the opportunity to explain what I did. \n\nWith this is in mind I have two questions:\n\n1. Did I screw up when submitting my fafsa?\n\n2. When I submit my parents' tax return for verification will I get in trouble with the school and/or the federal government?

She seems to be perfect for me. We have the same hobbies, love the same music etc. . I will also meet her again in a few days and just knowing that makes me so happy. I would really be the luckiest person on this planet and in the entire galaxy if she would be my gf but the problem about this is that she is in a relationship with her boyfriend for nearly 2 years which makes everything so difficult.\n\nDuring the seminar we were on it also came to a moment when we were tickling each other a bit and then our foreheads touched. We looked us both in the eyes for a couple of seconds but I didn't know what to do. I would have maybe gone for a kiss there if she wouldn't have been in a relationship. But most of the time we spent together or with the people we liked. We also sang Karaoke together danced a bit and talked for like an hour about the problems we have/had. It felt like she is the one for me.\n\nShe even lives together with her bf since a few months which makes it even more difficult for me to date her or something like that. It seems to me that waiting for them to break-up is my only possible way to even get her to date me which makes me sad\n\nTL;DR:",

Now Shelly and my gf are/were very close growing up and were best friends until Shelly went away for college. This is understandable as Shelly is a decent bit older.\n\nWhen talking to my gf she stated that she was a little salty about the wedding itself as when they were younger Shelly promised her she would be in the bridal party due to how close they were.

Normally only her family would have gone, but her younger sister was going to be on a trip to Europe so she would be more or less alone is terms of age group at the wedding.

She didnt say much at the time towards it, but now has expressed her anger towards the situation to me in private. She feels like she is over it and being able to bring me was a compensation from Shelly for not having her in the bridal party.

We decided we still want to stay together, but he wants to be in an open relationship. We've talked about it before, we both think it would be fun/beneficial. I know that right now I can't emotionally handle it though. I'm pretty confident in myself but I'm still a jealous girlfriend. Not overly jealous, but I mean I still have feels. He wants to start the open relationship now because he feels like he's just going to get older and unattractive. He said he understood how I felt and would be patient with me. So we're not rushing into anything. \nWe both love each other very much, we're each others best friend.

When I first moved in, 2 other girls in their early twenties were living in the other two rooms on the second floor, where my room also is. About a week after I moved in, an 80 year old woman moved into the room on the first floor. Considering I live in an almost exclusively college-aged building and neighborhood, this was a little weird and unexpected, but not really a huge deal.\n\nThe problem, unfortunately, is that she is incontinent and smells strongly of urine. To compound matters, she has basically turned the entire living room into an extension of her bedroom and spends all day sitting in there. When I accidentally made the mistake of sitting of \"her\" coach, I quickly found the entire cushion was soaked through. The smell permeates the entire first floor of our apartment. Initially we tried to address this by leaving air fresheners all over the first floor and keeping the windows open. While this didn't completely mask the smell, it helped enough that we could at least go downstairs. Now that it's winter in Wisconsin, we've had to close our windows and the smell is unbearable. It's gotten to the point where we hardly ever use the kitchen or living room, and can basically never have people over.\n\nMy other roommates and I have decided we need to finally find some way to address this with her but have no idea how to bring it up. On the few occasions where we've tried to talk about other concerns with her (such as leaving half eaten meat and dairy products in our dish cabinet for days on end) she became very hostile and defensive.

Growing up, we had two dogs for the better part of 10 years and recently had to lose one to illness. Our current dog is an 11 year old Pointer mix who was never properly house-trained during those 10 years and has therefore developed house-soiling habits. Growing up I never really paid attention to it as I figured my dad whom had read a few books on the matter had claimed we could fix these habits. I've recently come to understanding that everyone in the house has simply given up on fixing this issue and it annoys me. With a new dog coming into the picture later this summer and a lot of free time this summer I'd like to fix this issue. \n\nThe dog, Ella, has habits of peeing on a training pad at the front door anytime we leave the house or when we go to bed. When she notices we go upstairs to get to bed in the evening, she will within 5 mins, pee on her pad, regardless of whether she's been out for a walk or in the backyard in the past hour. When we leave for extended periods of time(4+ hours) she will poop in the living room creating quite the unpleasant smell for a few hours. \n\nA relative dog trainer has proposed changing where the training pads are to putting them beside the backdoor, and then gradually showing her to go outside. I've attempted to move the training pad and she will generally move her soiling area to where the pad is however, I'm uncertain on how to go about showing her to go outside or rather how to not pee in the house as I don't believe her issue is a lack of understanding that outside=toilet but rather that her issue stems from the lack of understanding that inside=/= toilet.\n\nAny tips or help in how to break this habit?

She has given me the permission to go and sleep with whoever I want.\nThis has been the most drama filled friends with benefits relationship I've had. About every month she wants to break it off, so we do but then we always end up resuming where we left it off. Well in the past few weeks I've been thinking really hard about how I feel about her and I would really like to date her exclusively. Last night definitely reaffirmed it when I tried hooking up with another girl and I just kept thinking about her and like I said before I've never felt guilty about hooking up with other girls before until now and the worst is we are in an open relationship. I finally have what I always wanted. Someone I can hang out with and I get to have a great time and she also lets me see whoever I want. But the problem is I don't want that anymore. I'm pretty sure I couldn't handle the thought of her being with someone else. I definitely know that shes the only girl I want to be with at the moment.\nI also know she really doesn't want a relationship. This is her first friends with benefits she ever had. I can tell she really enjoys the freedom of being able to do whatever she wants and not be constricted to only one person.\n\nAnyways, judging from old patterns I can only wonder when she wants to just be friends again. I'm torn between ending it now before I become even more attached than I already am or should I just stick it through and see what will come of it.\n\nTL;DR:",

Back in early December I met this girl, we'll call her X, while at a quiz bowl tournament. We hit it off almost instantly, traded phone numbers in the biggest coincidence ever (to me at least), and then shortly thereafter we were unofficially dating. Skip forward to late January, we're pretty interested in each other. I finally get the balls to officially ask her out after forgetting several times before on the 8th of this monthmonth. My forgetfulness was attributed to me having such a great time with her that I forgot everything else.

Recently, since we're ahead of schedule, I've been coming home early. Track season's also getting into swing and as a result I'm busy every day of the week as well as several Saturdays. When I'm not doing any of these things I'm worrying about my college physics, trig, or assorted other assignments.\n\nThis has gotten to the point I never get to talk to her anymore and she's disappointed with me more often than anything.

We would have a really good week, one where he was busy, one where he would ignore me, one where he would break up with me, and then the next we were back together. For two years.

I don't cringe thinking about him with another woman. I don't care. I just still feel like \"he's around the corner\" even though he hasn't tried once to contact me. I guess I feel like he let go of our relationship so easily when he normally springs back and comes up with some excuse on why we should get back together. He emotionally manipulated and gaslighted me our entire relationship. He was extremely selfish and I took him back every time. I guess I still feel out of sorts because I'm waiting for the cycle to start again. It hasn't.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to feel like it really is done with? 5 months is the longest we haven't communicated. I know we are broken up for good.

Recently there has been a lot more strain, partly because we were long distance for a while, and partly because he has been spending increasing time at his fraternity and less time hanging out with me. We usually see each other at least every other day, but he usually only wants to hang out if it's at the fraternity house.\n\nAs a 22 year old girl, I've already graduated college and work 5 full days a week. He is doing an internship and can pretty much choose his own hours, so he gets upset that I don't want to party every night. He stays up until 2 or 3 am every night, and only hangs out at his frat house. I can't convince him to go out with my friends and me, and he will rarely go to bars or apartment parties. I don't like being at the frat because I'm the oldest girl there by 3 years, and I just think it's really immature. \n\nI still love him a lot, but it's been ages since he's asked me to hang out in a situation that wasn't at the frat house. I try to take him places and sometimes he'll agree, but he's almost never at my apartment and the only nights we spend together at at the fraternity. He assures me that this is only because classes haven't started yet (our school starts very late) and he is making the most of summer. It's putting a huge strain on me, though, because all of my friends go out on romantic dates and I'm just stuck drinking cheap beer with underage kids in a frat house. \n\nHe's never cheated on me, but lots of girls text him constantly and they're all over him when I'm at the frat. They know me as \"Mrs. *his name*\" so I know nothing fishy is going on, but it's still a little weird to me that he has so many girl friends.\n\nTL;DR:",

I listened in and I heard him come up with a jumble of excuses including the name of a male coworker, and the fact that he was just curious. My mom then refuted this with the fact that he went directly to the ad- it wasn't totally like he was casually browsing. When she told him he would be sleeping on the couch- and he asked why- she said that his face explained it all.

If they're going to create some Frankenstein mis-matched music video that completely erodes my benefits from the project.\n\nAnd so, since they had not paid after ≈45 days, I emailed their manager saying that I was not okay with this and wanted to re-negotiate terms as I still own copyright on all of my material, had yet to sign anything, and have not been paid.\n\nI'd like to make them several offers... such as allowing them to pay the original $500 and post my original video without any edits.

If it's not an appropriate question, please let me know and I'll remove it. Also, thank you in advance for any guidance, insight, or direction you can offer.\n\nI started reading Reddit about a year ago after I got out of a two year relationship. I took that break up really hard, and it sucked moving out when we made a home together, but I knew that we were not a good fit. Reddit helped me rebuild myself into a better, more confident man as I reentered the dating world. After a handful of dates, I started a relationship again about six months ago. Now that relationship has ended and I'm taking it pretty hard.\n\nI'm just afraid I'm bad at meeting women. I don't really like to go out to bars or clubs much, and I don't know where else to meet interesting women who I might be interested in, and whom will be interested in me. I'm genuinely afraid of being alone forever at this point (as illogical as that is for anyone to fear).\n\nA little about me: I am 23. I suffer from some depression/anxiety that has gotten worse over the years and got severe after the most recent break up. I am currently in therapy getting it treated and seeing about medication next week. I am in a clinical psychology Ph.D. program. I think I'm average looking. I try to be well dressed. I ride motorcycle, cook, into classic film/literature, hit the gym ~5 days a week, bicycle, and I'm starting fencing.\n\nI guess what I'm wondering is, where can I meet women with my busy schedule? How can I make myself more confident and attractive? I'm just feeling a bit lost and worried and I'm looking for any guidance.\n\nTL;DR:",

I receive donations and sort them into different categories. My workplace is somewhat hazardous. It's a little dusty in the production room. Sometimes, I need to climb over a half-wall to grab a wood palette and bulk box, and walk along the wall, lifting each over my head to avoid the scratching/breaking the sold furniture. My wrists hurt from carrying and throwing bags and boxes of stuff over my head into piles, in order to keep our pathways clear. My lower back is slightly sore. I have a wicked watch tan, even though I wear sunblock. So, you can imagine that the job is taking a toll on my health. \n\nI get along with all my co-workers, including my manager. But I'm somewhat stuck as a donation attendant here because 1) we're short-handed in donations, 2) I'm a young(er) male who can lift heavy stuff, and 3) only cashiers (off the record) have been promoted to 3rd key holder. \n\nI'm interviewing for a position at Target. If I get the job, they want me for the weekends, which I have no problem with, but they only offer 20 to 25 hours. So I may need to have my hours reduced at the Goodwill, or quit the Goodwill altogether - possibly severing my rapport with everyone at the Goodwill since we're already short-handed. Even if I stay with hours reduced, I can forget about any promotion.\n\nDo I take the 20-25 hour job at Target, and risk losing (quitting) my current job. Or do I wait for a better retail opportunity? Thanks in advance.\n\nSide-note: During my time off, I'm studying/coding for front-end web development. The better I get at this, the sooner I can/hope to leave retail.\n\nTL;DR:",

Do you think he could love me [F19]?\n\nPOST: We've been going out for 2 years and we live together. The whole time I've known him, he's been very antisocial. He always stays home, never goes out. Lately he's been getting a lot of headaches. The doctor suggested he see a psychologist. After 7 sessions the psych finally managed to diagnose him and now he's being referred to someone who deals with personality disorders.\n\nOne time at a party a guy bumped into him and made some condescending comment, my bf just walked away, but he was literally twitching in anger the whole night. Often when we go on dates, he'll just come up with some random persona out of nowhere and literally act like that all night. He'll stop if I ask him to but he seems to enjoy pretending to be someone else. I thought it was just him having fun. I guess it still is, but it just seems so much more nefarious now. These things occurred to me after he told me his diagnosis.\n\nI didn't know what it was when he told me. But we researched it together and he said that most of the symptoms seemed right. He said he used to get into trouble a lot, but he learned how to control his anger and \"read people.\" He said he realized he was different early on and learned how to adapt. I have a problem with it because people with ASPD supposedly can't get close to anyone. He agreed and said that he can't get close to anyone, but I'm the exception, that he loves me. I'm not sure what to do. I want to believe that he loves me. I know that he's the same guy as he's always been, but honestly I'm a little scared of him now. I think it's a good sign that he told me what it is because people with ASPD are supposed to have trust issues, but he trusted me with this. I know that he doesn't trust anyone else though.

I've gone through the wiki and while it has confirmed some of the things he has taught me about the topic, I'd like to get a second opinion on the matter of credit card count.\n\nFor some basic background, I am rather stable financially, have a solid savings account to handle any kind of emergency, a solid credit score for being in my mid 20's (Mid-high 700's).

I see the advantage of opening up one as it gives another line to report on long term, but I try to approach things from a practical standpoint.  I have my credit card used for only specific things and auto payments set up to pay the balance automatically, and I have not actually needed an additional card because I work hard to make sure that I keep myself in as little debt as possible so from a fiscal standpoint at the moment the issue is to me: I have enough money set aside for emergencies of most kinds that I don't NEED a credit card to handle it, so is it even worth getting a second one?\n\nI'm aware too that I could ask for an increase increase in the limit on my existing card and likely get it with no problem, but then I would want to approach the situation with the mindset of: one card is for general use like I am already doing with specific kinds of purchases, and the other would be there for something bigger, like some large piece of furniture and the like, to which I again cannot forsee anything at the moment where I would want to put down $1000+ on something all at once.\n\nTL;DR:",

It wasn't until they tried signing it to me that it was noticed and now the true miles are \"unknown\". This puts a red flag on my Carfax and makes my title a box c.

But she never told me the reason why, so I had to find out through some other friends.\n\nWe eventually ended up together again but last week the same thing happened and I since then haven't even had contact with my ex since I knew how things ended.

I really enjoy reading inspiring stories of people who lost a lot of weight and have kept it off. I just wanted to share my story to those seeking motivation. This is my first post on reddit ever so I hope I did everything right.\n\nDuring my senior year of college, I weighed my heaviest at 230 lbs. From eating unhealthy to late night frat parties, I was destroying myself but didn't really care.  I tried 4 years on and off to lose weight with some success but would gain it right back. \n\nI started a new job in 2010 and my weight stayed in the range of 195 - 205 due to constant work travel and late work nights. In March 2012, my twin brother (who was the fit one in the family) forced me to make a promise to run the Disney World 2013 Half-Marathon with him. I had never ran more than a 5K in my life. 13.1 miles seemed daunting.\n\nWith a promise made and his motivation, I set up a running program and made myself run (I also did cross-training on my rest days). I swore off fast food and soft drinks (I can't even drink them now because they are too sweet for me!). I started to do my research on what foods to eat and started cooking my own food more. The pounds started coming off within a few weeks and months. My goal was to run and finish with my brother. \n\nI hit my goal weight of 175 in May 2012. Much earlier than I thought but I maintained my fitness goal and weight and ran the Disney World Half-Marathon with him last month. I almost cried when I crossed the line with him as it was a close of a chapter in my life that I had struggled with since college.\n\nNow, my goal this year is to run my first marathon and to do the Goofy Challenge with my brother in 2014 (39.3 miles in two days).

This is my first post here so please bear with me if anything is out of place.\n\nI know for a fact that I struggle with social situations.\n\nA little background. I'm 24, I am a senior psychology undergraduate student. And yes, I am going into the mental health field. My friends often come to me for advice, consolation, and the like, which I don't mind, and in fact, I love giving advice when I have the emotional energy to help.\n\nI've been recently finding myself in situations where I feel taken advantage of: where neither my humanity, my needs, nor my obligations are observed, and that I am expected to be either the fixer or the problem-solver whenever other people need. I kind of feel as if I am treated as someone who does not actually have these functions.\n\nAnd in some cases, I feel many relationships become imbalanced or where the only aspect of the relationship is listening to problems; never low key things like playing video games together, bonding over pizza, or taking a walk in the sunshine. Or watching Netflix together. Or hanging out in the same room, quietly, doing my own thing with someone else there if something needs to be said. Talking about the universe!?! Or even just about how a crazy day went.\n\nI know I've always had a problem with setting boundaries because my automatic assumption is that others mean well and that I should be patient with them, though clearly that is not always the case. Some people have strictly used me to vent – basically not valuing me outside of the benefit that I'm a person they come to to fix things.\n\nI don't know what boundaries I need to set, or how to make them known, so I don't end up in dynamics that end up being one-sided and not fulfilling at best, toxic at worst.\n\nI like helping people, this includes listening to them when I have a bad day, but how do I make the distinction to others and draw the line between what's acceptable and what's not?\n\nI would appreciate constructive feedback on how to improve my life for the better.\n\nTL;DR:",

After a while of mutual rubbing she move my hand to her breasts and grabbed my crotch.

Straight out of school (doctoral-level), I got my current job. I've been there now for right at a year, and while I love my job and my coworkers, there are a few downsides. First, I have to commute nearly an hour each way on a busy, dangerous interstate. My office is about 50 miles from my home. Also, while I have excellent benefits and some flexibility to my schedule, I'm grossly underpaid for my position. \n\nThat being said, I've been pretty happy and wasn't actively looking for another job; however, I was just offered a job with much better pay, plus it's a telehealth (work-from-home) type job. This is huge considering I just had a baby and hate being so far away from her at my current job. My husband and I feel like this job is a better fit for me right now, but I'm feeling extreme anxiety and guilt over telling my boss. My boss has become a good friend in the time I've been here and has been so good to me. Not to mention I already feel bad because she and her husband have been going through a really hard time trying to have (and keep) a baby, and my husband and I came up pregnant unexpectedly a few months after I started my job and now have a healthy baby girl. I already had to break the news that I was pregnant, now here I am again with upsetting news. I just got back from a 6 week maternity leave about a month ago.\n\n Also I should mention that our clinic is not very large, so if I leave right now (my job offer wants me to start in two weeks), it leaves her with a ton of extra work until she finds my replacement.

I am not the boyfriend who wants to hear from her ALL night long but I am the boyfriend that needs to know shes home safe or at least staying at a friends house. hearing her say goodnight even if VIA text makes me happy and allows me to sleep easy. Multiple times now, about 4 or so, within the past month...mostly all when she goes out...she doesnt call or text me most of the night until later in the afternoon the next day or in the morning as soon as she wakes up. Usually consists of \"Her friend stole her phone\", \"Phone dropped out of her purse at work and didnt realize till she got home\"....I can't tell if I am being paranoid or what because I get super annoyed and mad when I have to sit around all night and the next day just to know she's ok? This is the ONLY thing I ever get mad at her for and idk.... shes teh same way if I dont text her while im out or what have you and she gets really annoyed if my phone dies while I'm out but I always text or call her as soon as I get home to let her know im home and safe.\n\nAny suggestions on what to do and how to handle this so I dont seem smothering, jealous...etc?\n\nTL;DR:",

I still think she's super nice and I really like her but, eeh I don't know. I don't want to sound like an asshole, but I think sex is important in a relationship.... maybe it's just because I'm a horny teen, maybe I just rushed in like a crazy mofo, I'm new to this, but I don't want to go on like this and don't know what to do without hurting her feelings\n\nTL;DR:",

I've been dating her for just over 4 months and overall things are going really well. However over the past couple of weeks I've realized that I'm always the one asking her to hang out and go on dates places. We hang out 1-2 times per week and out of the ~30 we've been together she's asked to hang out twice.\n\nShe always says yes - in fact, she hasn't even once asked to do something other than what I've suggested. She's been away a lot the past couple of weeks, and says things like \"I miss you so much it hurts\" \"I wish you were here\" \"I have so many stories to tell you\" etc., so it's pretty confusing as to why she just doesn't ask to hang out.\n\nLike last night at 10:15 we were texting and she jokingly asked if I wanted to come over; we joked about me sneaking out and stuff like that and then I said \"yeah I dont think tonight will work..I do want to come over though\" And still nothing. Changed topic and then she went to bed around 11.. She probably expected me to ask her but it's frustrating because I feel like if she was actually interested she'd start asking once in a while.\n\nOh, another thing that's semi-related: Whenever she comes to my house, she's consistently an hour+ late. No excuses or anything - for example if I ask her to come over at 5 she'll text me at 5:30 saying she's starting to walk over....However that's the only time she's late; whenever we go out somewhere she's on time, and when I go over to her house she's always there/ready to hang out.\n\nI just want to know if this is anything to worry about and what I should do about it.

It's more of a frustration than anything else, but since it's mild and if I try hard I can focus, it's not worth adding to the statistics of an already over-diagnosed disorder.\n\nBut I tried one of my friend's Adderall's this morning at work, and after the initial paranoia of what's going to happen after trying a new drug, I had 6 of the most efficient hours of work I can remember.  It was unbelievable the focus and drive I had to complete task after task, all while happily ignoring my personal email account, text messages, and my usual distractions.\n\nWhat got me thinking was that I only took a third to half of my friend's pill, so I'm wondering what is it like for those of who have a strong case of ADD/ADHD? Does medication bring you to full focus like I experienced, or is it more controllable distractions? What are the days off the medication like? Do you ever avoid taking your meds because it feels like you're not being *you*?\n\nTL;DR:",

I told her she should try and not meet him in private but I wasn't very firm about it since i did trust her alot and i knew she'd never do something that would disappoint me . Well , that cost me . She did cheat on me with her ex twice while we were dating and now she's currently dating that guy . \n\nThe main problem here is that i don't really feel like its all her fault . Part of the reason she did cheat was probably because i didn't live up to her expectation of a good boyfriend. \n\nAfter this saga with her , I've had some serious trust issue with other people . I can safely say I didn't trust anyone more than her and now i cant trust anyone at all .

I don't really have an issue with that because I believe that sex is important and should only be shared by two people who love each other.

First, let me say that I don't believe in big government at all, but it's a reality in our world and I don't see a way for there to be a successful country with little government or a complete lack there of. I don't want to argue this point because government and opinions on it are entirely subjective and if you don't agree with me than that's chill but I'd rather focus on the topic at hand.\n\nMy idea basically works like this, in order for you to drive a car you'd have to be 15/16 depending on what the state allows, but instead of waiting until you're 18 to have your restrictions removed (driving past 12am for example) you'd just wait until you graduate high school, the same thing would go or cigarettes, a credit card, or anything that requires you to be 18 years of age, in essence a HS diploma/GED would be the equivalent to being 18 years old in our current system.\n\nTo take this further, the government could enforce a law that states you need an associates, or two years of formal education at a higher level institution to be granted access to restrictions that are 21+. So if you wanted to drink alcohol for example you'd have to attend college for two years and have something to show for it; proof of enrollment with the goal of a four year degree or an associates degree. If per chance you never ended up getting your degree the two years of higher education would simply be enough to continue enjoying the perks of being 21+ in our current system. \n\nUltimately, I think this is a much better system because it really makes education an even bigger factor in our lives and even if you hate committing the two years to college so you can buy alcohol then at least you got some knowledge and knowledge is pretty cool and useful. \n\ndoes this sound feasible? Or is this just crazy talk?\n\nTL;DR:",

It got around to 6 in the evening and I haven't heard anything, so I decide to text her, I get a response, we talk for a bit, and now nothing.\n\nSo my question is, am I overthinking things and should I be worried or should I just remain calm and let things play out and hope that Friday night wasn't just a one-night stand kind of thing?

Sure enough in 1/4 mile a pull out lane appeared on the right, the perfect opportunity for someone who doesn't feel comfortable going too fast to pull over and make room. We had seen it many times before, especially families in rented RVs, would pull over and we'd give a courtesy wave and pass by. But no, not this time, not this car. The Cabrio was either too dead set on carrying on or just totally clueless at the growing ranks of cars stuck behind them to bother pulling over and letting everyone pass. Demoralized and frustrated we continued to watch the motorcade grow to 13 vehicles trapped behind the evil white Cabrio. Several dotted passing lines came and went along with many gestures of exasperation from the drivers behind us.  It seemed fate was not on our side this day until finally our moment came:\n\nWide open, clear visibility, straight road with a dotted line.

I am not getting what I need: empathy, attempts at understanding, the benefit of the doubt, compassion, compromise. The compromise I do get comes with something that feels like resentment, manifested with an attitude of \"let's just get through this\".\n\nExample: I'm kind of into board games and I asked her if she wanted to play one with me. She paused and said \"sure\". I let her pick one, we started playing, and she was in a shit mood the whole time. I hope it's understandable that this makes it hard for me to enjoy it. I asked her gently what was up and whether she was having fun. She said \"as much as last time\". She wouldn't make eye contact with me the whole time without giving me a \"what?!\" face, and she was stoic and nearly silent the whole time. I was glad when the game was over. I would have ended it early but that would have escalated the situation so I just kept my enjoyment face on and hammered it out so we could move on. I don't know why she couldn't just say she wasn't into it.\n\nMost of our conversation seems to include parts wherein one of us is correcting the other or disagreeing without signs of listening. I've noticed this and I'm trying to adjust my communication, but it seems like the only \"constructive\" thing I've been able to do is to interact less and less. She seems to get way emotional very quickly and it raises the stakes on the simplest of conversations. Stuff like which car to drive and what to eat for dinner have me on edge, and it feels like any conversation where we have differing opinions needs to be resolved or avoided as quickly as possible because of how emotionally charged it will inevitably get.\n\nI'm concerned that this is my fault and I need to understand what I can do better.\n\nTL;DR:",

It will take ~30 minutes by bus to get there, versus 1.5 hours for university A.

I met this guy 7th grade and things were splendid. We had the exact same interests: videogames, music, comedy. We became super close and I trusted this guy with everything. He was a genius, nice to everyone he came across, yet always came off as cocky. There was never a moment he missed to prove he was superior to somebody. The closer we became the more we integrated into each other's group of friends. We soon began to have petty arguments and fight over stupid things. I could never win an argument against this guy. When I did win an argument providing proof of something I was correct the entire time, he would become angry (at times wanted to start a brawl) and not speak to me. He knew my empathy would then cause me to apologize and he took pleasure in the fact. Things took a turn for the worst when in high school he had sex with one of my ex-girlfriends. This did not bother me one bit to be honest, due to the fact this girl had cheated on me. (I was initially hurt but it's highschool so I got over it fairly quickly) I blew it off and actually bro'd out with him about it, but then began to see his true colors. There was a point where he caught me having a casual conversation with his girlfriend (we were in high school marching band) and he was not going to let that pass. He literally turned our friends against me for about a solid week until I apologized and thoroughly explained what happened; again my empathy kicking in. I inherently thought the whole thing was my fault, similar to many other arguments we had had in the past; it was ALWAYS my fault. \n\nFast forward a few years. I'm 20 now and we went to different colleges but still texted everyday, played Xbox online on the weekends and went to concerts and hung out during holidays.

Until a teacher came into the class room and told us that we could leave early today (10 am). Now i had a problem because this happened before i got my drivers license. And the way i normally transported myself back and forth was with a taxi.\nNormally the taxi wouldn't show up till 2.30 pm, so i tried to get the taxi to show up sooner so i didn't have to wait, but i was told that wasn't possible.\n\nAnd this is where everything went wrong.

So i had the brilliant idea of driving all the way home by myself. In my wheelchair. Out on the road. First of all it was pretty scary driving on a road where people were only inches away from hitting me multiple times, but the worst thing happened when i was half-way home. The chair gave out... I remembered, stupid as i was, that i had forgotten to charge the battery on my chair. I just made it past the road sign and was stranded at the sidewalk. So i sat there for an hour, normally that wouldn't be a problem but i also forgot to mention that i didn't bring any warm clothes and it was in the middle of the winter. And to top it all of when sitting there in misery, hating myself for being stupid, one of my friends drove past me in his car waving and smiling like an idiot, because he couldn't see that i was stranded and he just drove on. But my luck finally changed for just a short period of time.

He told me about it the next day and we discussed it. I decided to give it another chance because the relationship was awesome in pretty much every other respect, including honesty.\n\nThings went well and now we have been dating for 7 months. He is off visiting his family now but he messaged me this morning saying that he had logged in to my Facebook yesterday because I had taken an exceptionally long time to respond to his last message and he was paranoid. He said he didn't look at anything (frankly I don't care if he did. There's nothing I wouldn't want him seeing, but it bothers me that he decided to look anyway), and just felt bad and logged back out immediately.\n\nHowever, I got a notification that someone had tried to log into my Facebook that morning (must have been him), but also that evening. He did not mention the second time. That would have been after I had responded to him.\n\nI have talked about this with him and my concerns are that, while I want this to work, I don't want to be a pushover. I understand it can be easy to be a pushover when you are really into the person you are dating (been there enough for sure), but seriously, this is the only problem we've had in our relationship. I am still waiting for his response (I can only communicate with him through Facebook because he is abroad right now), but he wasn't entirely honest with me about how many times he tried to log in and I fear that, even if he doesn't plan to do it again, like he says, he'll lose respect for me anyway if I decide to stay with him.

We started with \"Ripped in 30\" on MWF and \"Extreme Shed and Shred\" on TuTh(Sa). Some people even added Kickboxing to MWF to get an hour's worth of fitness in.

Before my girlfriend and I started going out, we were pretty much best friends. Although we didn't have a lot of things in common, it was easy for us to talk and laugh with one another which was great. Throughout these years I've known her, I'm always really comfortable around her and would tell her anything. \n\nRecently we got into an argument and we realized how much we were different from one another. Throughout our relationship, there were petty differences such as food and music, but after that argument, I realized it was much more than that. Our values are different. After the talk, she dropped the bomb of \"do you see us being together in the long run?\" and I said yes and that was the end of that night around 2 weeks ago. \n\nAfter that night, everything has been normal. We still talk a lot and text a lot. But that question she asked that night has been in the back of my mind every single day because I'm not sure if \"yes\" was exactly the right answer. I'm afraid that if I end things with her, I'm not only just going to lose my girlfriend, I'm going to be losing my best friend as well. She has given me so much in this relationship and has really changed my life for the better. Not to mention that she was also my first kiss, first girlfriend, and a first for many other things if you know what I mean ;) \n\nSo yeah, I don't exactly know what to do in this situation. Do I love her? Yes, I do but I don't know... I have the feeling that she loves me A LOT more than I love her.  Is this just some \"phase\" I'm going through because we've been going out for so long? Is it because I'm in college and I'm surrounded by so many new people? I don't know... please give me some advice and help me out here.\n\nTL;DR:",

If he's convicted/pleads guilty, will some of the fine be restitution?\n\nPOST: I work at a consignment shop that funds a charity. A couple of months ago I received a tip that our manager, who had been at the shop for about 12 years, had been committing fraud for almost that long. My tipster gave me a flash drive filled with evidence, which I used to prepare an info packet, which I sent to the home office.\n\nThe manager's crimes were of a few different types: \n\n1. He misappropriated funds that belonged to the charity in order to purchase expensive items from the shop.\n\n2. He created fake accounts to sell his own items, and perhaps items that had been donated to the shop, at terms extremely favorable to him; in some cases he took 100% of the proceeds. He thus committed check fraud by then cashing the checks for these non-existent consignors. He once used the name of a friend of his, thus forging her signature and impersonating her. \n\n3. He sometimes would simply remove the sales tax from the transaction, thus committing tax fraud.\n\nHe was quickly fired, and the investigations are almost done. A few different committees will meet later this month, and the Board of Directors has the final say on how to proceed. \n\nSo, people at the charity would like to recover what was taken, on top of what the higher-ups had to spend on investigations and such. They are also concerned with preventing this from happening to any other non-profit, because as of right now the ex-manager is apparently telling people that he quit because of conflicts with the home office. He could probably get another, similar job, and nobody would be the wiser. It's critical for our charity to save its reputation, because that affects nearly everything.\n\nApparently a civil suit will be unlikely, since it would cost much more in legal costs and forensic investigation than the charity could ever recover. However, it won't cost them anything to file a police report. \n\nSo,\n\nTL;DR:",

Me and my girlfriend were sitting at home watching television and close to starving, so we decide to order some pizza for pickup from a place down the street. Decent pizza and pretty cheap, so I get in my truck and drive my lazy ass about two blocks away. As I walk up to the door I notice a small child, maybe 8-10 years old walking toward the door with his arms full of pizza, crazy bread and a couple sodas. He leans with his back against the door to open it just as I get close, so I decide to help him out and pull the door open. Well, I guess he was leaning pretty hard and ate shit. Pizza boxes fly, crazy bread erupts into the air in slow motion like those fucking stupid canned snake things. Just as his head cracks off the concrete I pull him up, ask if he is okay (which he was), and help him recover his bounty of little caesars.

This was elective, so I had to pay for it, but I had been thinking about this for a REALLY long timeand it was really important to me. I realized how much time was going by without finding a meaningful partner and many of my other girlfriends at Uni now have SO's, and I figured I could do everything I could to make myself more appealing. I mean, also I'm doing more substantial stuff like yoga and meditation and trying to be more social with the greek communities here and do community service stuff. So its a whole betterment kick Ive been on. \n\nAnyway, since it was an elective surgery, and because my parents are EXTREMELY conservative, I paid for it myself out of my PLUS that I took out. So it's my choice, my money. Anyway, I did this while at Uni actually last spring. I did it privately, my body, so I didn't tell the family about it because I knew they would freak. Anyway, I had to come home eventually and they did FREAK and actually caused some serious problems. My mother isnt even speaking to me anymore and my father barely is. I just tried to ignore that for a few weeks, but then eventually my mom said that she was so upset that I had to move out! Now she is threatening to not pay for my senior year, which means I will have to take out more loans. I really needed this surgery and I think my mom is being unreasonable. Luckily, I was able to stay with a friend until school opens up on Tuesday but anyway, I wanted to ask if anyone has any tips on how to make my mother understand that this is my body, my decisions and I needed this?? She cries all the time whenever I try to call and just basically hangs up. Thats such a crazy over reaction. I am getting good grades, and Im not a fuck up so why disown me?

Please don't downvote the people calling me an asshole.  I need to work through this and need some honesty.\n\nI was recently in a relationship with a girl for a year.  Things were going very well, I was even planning on moving to be with her.  (It was a LDR)  In November I started a new job and met a girl who was basically my twin, but with great boobs.  This girl and I flirted a lot and hung out non-sexually probably a half dozen times but I didn't want it to go anywhere since I was in love with my then-gf.\n\nFast forward to a month ago.  Two weeks before I moved to be with my ex, she calls me up and breaks up with me over the phone.  [Should include something fairly personal about me here, I have mild anti-social personality disorder.  I do not form exceptionally strong ties to people and never get sad for more than a day or so over the loss of an SO/friend.]  We talk on the phone for about an hour, she tells me that she loves me but doesn't see me being in the picture when she looks 5 years down the road and wants to end it now.  We end on good terms.\n\nFast forward SIX MEASLY DAYS.  The girl from work and I are hanging out and get drunk.  Pretty stinking drunk.  We kiss a little bit and the next thing I know, I'm biting her thighs teasing her before I show her my cunning linguistic skills.  A few days later and we are dating.  I make it clear to her that she isn't a rebound and that I think I have been hiding these feelings from myself for months.\n\nMy ex is furious.  She says she feels cheap because she was so easy to get over.  To make matters worse, I can be outrageously sarcastic if I think someone is being unfair with me.  I ask her, \"You dumped me.

He kept begging me to forgive him but I really can't do that. I can forgive a lot of things but I can't forgive this. I told him it was over for good and that I don't want to speak to him anymore. \n\nI also talked to the girl he was cheating with. She contacted me on FB and told me everything that happened. I almost feel worse for her than I do for myself, if that even makes sense. I made sure she knew that I was not mad at her. Seeing all the pictures of her and him together during times when I thought he was doing something else pretty much ripped my heart out again though.

After the fireworks, we were all pretty wasted and me and my GF where not hanging out together. I was talking to some people, and she was talking to some other people. Not a big deal, obviously. But after a while, i started looking for her and then i find her down in the basement playing League of Legends on the hosts computer with a couple of guys looking at her playing. I kinda freaked out a little bit, but didnt show anyone that i did because i didnt want to make a scene. So i just left the house with a friend for a little bit to calm myself down.\n\nNow, my question is: Was i wrong in freaking out about this? The people at the party were all gamers too, and like i said, she was not down there alone. She was talking to those who sat there while she was playing etc...

To me, this would've never been an option because i was at someone's party :s  I just need some opinions here, because i dont know what to do...! \n\nSidenote: I have talked to her about it, and we both apologized for what happened and put it in the past.

I asked around my older friends and managed to get him a set of LSAT prep books and account details for a well-reviewed online prep course.

We discussed it, I agreed I'd go with back up plan, and he thought this was a compromise.\n\nLikewise, sex has become an issue.

So there are 4 of us, so I suggested 'lets get one of these deals'\n\nMy ex's response was 'I'll ask the girls'\n\nThe girls say 'He can stay in the same hotel, but different room'\n\nThe girl's reasoning is they think that emotions between me and my ex will ruin their trip.

I am seriously a hardworker and I try my best to not be lazy when it comes to science.\n\nHowever, here lies my problem: A couple of days ago, one of my mentors was helping me trouble shoot an experiment, and in the process sort of gave me a very stern talk about how I needed to write in my lab notebook more, and how I needed to be more present in the lab (not as in my attendance, but as in my mind needed to be there while I was doing my work). The point of the talk was that I needed to be able to stand up on my own two feet and stop asking so many redundant questions that have been answered over a million times. \n\nI agreed with what my mentor said and really, as much as I hated to admit it, my scientific method definitely needed improvement if I ever wanted to become a mature scientist. I have started to note down everything in my lab notebook, and am starting to be more attentive in lab. So, to gain more insight on the scientific method I am here, writing to you.

Basically, I like this girl. We're both 16 and in high school. However, I only share one class with her and it isn't really possible to talk to her in it. So we have limited conversation randomly.\n\nHere's the way the confusing part comes in. Sometimes we make quite a bit of eye contact in hallways and stuff and sometimes we don't. However, now I'm getting sick of it. The more I think about it, the more reasons I come up with to think that she doesn't like me. Also, she rarely initiates anything like texting or conversations when we can talk. She seems shy so I don't know if it's that or that she doesn't have any interest in me.\n\nSo at this point you're probably thinking, why don't you end the pain and ask her out already?\nFirst of all, I don't even really know what that means. I don't know if asking someone out means asking them to be your girlfriend/boyfriend or if it means asking someone on a date. If it's the first, I want to get to know her more first. If it's the second, I have never seen anyone in our school (it's small) ask someone on a date. So I guess that's weird in High School?\n\nAlso, with eye contact and hallways, I'm starting to worry that if she doesn't like me, she probably thinks I'm creepy since I look at her a lot more in hallways.

After I was done pitching I was put at catcher and whenever someone stole second base and I tried to throw them out my throw would be super slow and end up rolling or slowly bouncing to the second basemen. After all that when we were finishing up practice I took my compression sleeve off and the inside of my elbow was in a lot of pain, I told my mom and she made a doctors appointment for Friday. So the next day at practice I was warming up and stretching and my elbow popped again while throwing and it became painful to throw. So on Friday at the doctor I described my symptoms and stuff and he just kind of looked at it and said I probably had golfers elbow. Where I live there isn't a lot of baseball played so he didn't do any of the tests to check for any torn ligaments or something and he said come back in three weeks if it is still bugging me and to not pitch during that time. What my concern is, is that I tore or strained my ucl and that I may need surgery.\n\nTL;DR:",

We've been living together for the past year and I've never felt worse about our relationship. I feel like I don't know the cause behind this downward spiral either.\n\nBasically, we wake up early in the morning, are apart from each other all day while working and going to class (he's a senior and I'm a sophomore at our university), and then we carpool home around 6:00. We usually eat together but after that he's on his computer for the rest of the night. I constantly feel like I'm bothering him when I ask if he wants to hang out or have sex. \n\nHis libido has really dropped to the point where we have sex maybe three times a week, when I've tried to convey that I'd want to every day. \n\nI feel like I cater to his needs while he is totally dismissing mine. I make almost all of his meals, I clean the space that we're renting, I take care of our pets, and he doesn't lift a finger unless I literally beg.\n\nI hate talking about him like this because I feel that we never had these problems before. I just wonder if I should get out of this and find someone that maybe appreciates me or is willing to talk to me and have a closer relationship.

I have been told I cannot get a subsidy unless Medicaid rejects me.\n\nYet I feel rather unethical accepting Medicaid, given that I am the beneficiary of a rather sizable trust fund.
